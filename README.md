# MyBobaStory

I created this app with my personal experience in mind. When going to get boba drinks at any place, there is normally a large selection. A great way to experience what the boba shop has to offer is to try every single drink on the menu. One could go down the list in an orderly fashion but no one in their right mind is sane enough to do that. A type of checklist is the basic goal of this app. Of course it not preloaded with a menu from each shop(future goal?) so currently the user will have to enter the drink name, shop name, and date for each entry.

## Planning Story
In the beginning, it was overwhelming with how much freedom I had to make this application. Starting with the API was the first step I took because it's the foundation to how the app will work. Some tweaks were made to make sure it works with the  front end. Tested each feature with curl scripts then proceeded on. In the beginning I planned to have 3 tables; User, drinks, resturant. In the end, I kept it to 2 tables to keep it simple to make sure I can make the app work. As for the front end, I started with the authorization potion because that was a basic feature that was needed. I stated with putting all the buttons I needed and list into the app to get a visual of how things looked as I progressed and made small adjustments hoping it would not look cluttered on screen.

* As a user, I can create, view, update, delete the entries I've made into my Journal.

### Technologies used

* Ruby on Rails
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Heroku

### Unsolved Problems, Things to Do/Want to do

* Styling needed
* Recently updated drink is moved to last spot in list, have to click "Get Drinks" to refresh list on update and add drink.
* Initially able to refresh list after creating and removing a drink from list. However, had trouble displaying messages correct messages for each action.
* Bug with Add Drink. User is able to click in the open space next to the button still able to add drink.
* Populate with existing real life bobashops with menu items. Drink or food. Have a rating system that can be used. Dump it for bad Drunk it for good
